[A] Unlock your car with your phone. Open your front door with your phone. Order food with your phone. We are walking towards a future in which 
we combine many (if not all) of our daily activities on smartphones.

quickly, but not always the provided information is real. Discuss about fake news, how it can be prevented and why it is important to do so.

[C] You are going to another country to study. You would like to do a part-time job while you are studying, so you want to ask a friend 
who lives there for some help. In your letter:
- give details of your study plans
- explain why you want to get a part-time job
- suggest how your friend could help you find a job

### ANSWER

[A] Relying on our phones for everyday tasks like unlocking cars, opening doors, and ordering food is becoming more common. But how much 
should we depend on our phones for everything? Well, it depends. Using our phones for simple tasks can be convenient and save time. For example, 
if you're carrying groceries and your hands are full, it's handy to unlock your car with your phone. However, putting all our activities on 
one device might not be the best idea. Phones can get lost, stolen, or run out of battery. Plus, if something goes wrong with your phone, 
you could be stuck. So, it's good to balance. Use your phone for tasks that make sense, but don't rely on it for everything. Having backup 
options is smart too.

[B] Fake news is like gossip on steroids. It spreads fast and can cause a lot of harm. It's important to stop fake news because it messes 
with our understanding of the world. Imagine if you believed a fake story about a medicine being dangerous. You might avoid it when you really 
need it! Preventing fake news is tricky but not impossible. One way is to check multiple sources before believing a story. Also, be careful 
about sharing news before you know it's true. Social media platforms can also do more to stop fake news from spreading. They could verify 
information before it's shared widely. It's everyone's job to stop fake news, so we can all trust the information we see.

[C] Hey [Friend's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I'm excited to share that I'm planning to study abroad in your country! I've been accepted into a 
program at [Name of University] to study [Your Field of Study]. I can't wait to immerse myself in a new culture and expand my knowledge.

While I'm there, I'm hoping to find a part-time job to help with living expenses and gain some work experience. Having a part-time job 
will not only support me financially but also allow me to interact more with locals and improve my language skills.

I was wondering if you could help me in my job search. Since you're familiar with the area, you might know some places that are hiring 
students or have connections that could be useful. Any advice or assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated!

Looking forward to catching up soon.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
